# TypeScript Stack

This repo contains a simple example of a Stack data structure implemented in TypeScript. Stacks are a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This implementation uses an array to store the elements of the stack.
